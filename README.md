## About

This project was the introduction of setTimeout functions and creating dynamic elements using an array of objects.  Each question draws from popular drag queens that have been on the show called RuPaul's Drag Race throughout the years. For each question, you have to answer corrently the "fill in the blank" with the drag queen's name.

Each user is given 15 seconds to guess the correct answer, and if they correctly guess, then the host (RuPaul) will award the winner and the next answer is pulled up. The wins score will also be increased by 1.

When the user gives an incorrect answer, RuPaul will scold the user and then the losses score will increase by 1. Each time the answer is left unanswered, the same process will come about. When the user loses, the correct drag queen's name is listed underneath.

At the very end of the game, there is a screen that shows all the drag queens, and the number of wins, losses, and unanswered questions. The user is then given the choice to play again.
